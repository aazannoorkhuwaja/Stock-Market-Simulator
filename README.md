📈 Stock Market Simulator

A simple command-line based stock market simulator written in C++. This project allows users to buy and sell stocks using virtual currency while simulating changes in stock prices over time. It serves as a learning project to understand basic C++ concepts like file handling, arrays, conditionals, loops, and user interaction.

## Features

- Simulated stock trading (buy/sell)
- Virtual wallet for managing funds
- Randomized stock price fluctuations
- Portfolio tracking
- Easy-to-understand logic for beginners

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** g++ or any standard C++ compiler
- **Platform:** Command Line Interface (CLI)
